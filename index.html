                    Hi, I’m Samantha Nthamane Maphake, I am a Software Developer and a Data Analyst although I love to learn 
                    about most of the things that are in Information Technology such as Data Analytics, 
                    Software Development, Cloud Computing, Database Development and Business Intelligence.
                    My field is Software Development I chose this programme because being a Software Developer 
                    is useful to most companies as I can be able to create systems and integrate them with the
                    existing ones depending on the requirements of the project. I got to understand 
                    the concept of User Interface and User Experience before creating the actual system. At my 
                    previous tertiary studies I have been exposed to some of the programming languages that help 
                    in creating systems in Software Development. I have expanded my skills in web development
                    where I use HTML, CSS and Javascript, backend where I use .NET Framework lastly database 
                    management where I use Microsoft SQL to build scalable solutions. I thrive to contribute 
                    to teamwork with team members where we build exciting projects together and grow as we learn.
