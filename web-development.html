        <h2>Understanding Web Development</h2>
        <p class="post-date">Published on: 15th December 2024</p>
        <p>
            Web development is the process of building websites and web applications — the things you interact with
             every day, like online shops, news sites, banking apps, and social media platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are three main types of web development:
        </p>
        <p>
            1. Front-End Development (The “User Side”)
            This is everything you see and interact with on a website — buttons, forms, images, layout, menus, and 
            animations. It’s about design and user experience. Common tools used:
            <li>HTML – the structure or "skeleton" of the page</li>
            <li>CSS – controls colors, fonts, spacing, and overall style</li>
            <li>JavaScript – adds interactivity, like buttons that respond when clicked</li>
            <li>Frameworks like React, Vue, and Bootstrap make development faster and cleaner</li>
            Example: When you click “Add to Cart” on an online store, the front-end controls what happens visually.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. Back-End Development (The “Server Side”)
            This is what happens behind the scenes storing data, processing user requests, and connecting to databases. You don’t see it, but it powers everything.
            Technologies often used:
            <li>Node.js, PHP, Python, Java – for writing the logic</li>
            <li>Databases like MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL – where data is stored (like user accounts or orders)</li>
            Example: When you log into Facebook, the back-end checks if your email and password are correct.
        </p>
        <p>3. Full-Stack Development
            This means working on both front-end and back-end. A full-stack developer builds the complete system — from the layout users see to the database storing user info.
            They also use tools like:
            <li>Git and GitHub – to manage and share code</li>
            <li>Netlify, Vercel, or AWS – to deploy (publish) websites so people can access them online</li>
        </p>
            <p>Why It Matters
                Web development is everywhere — from school websites to online banking. It’s a skill that combines creativity (designing the user interface) and logic (making things work).
                Whether you’re building a personal blog or a global e-commerce site, web development brings ideas to life on the internet.</p>
