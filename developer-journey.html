        <h2>My Journey as a Software Developer</h2>
        <p class="post-date">Published on: 5th December 2024</p>
        <p>
            I began my journey in tech with simple things — learning how to write basic HTML to create a webpage.
            At the time, I didn’t fully understand what I was doing, but I loved the idea of building something from
             scratch that people could actually see and use.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I explored more, I started learning about CSS to style my pages, and JavaScript to make them interactive. 
            That opened up a whole new world of creativity and problem-solving. I eventually moved on to building full 
            websites and small applications — not just the front-end (what users see), but also the back-end (how it all 
            works behind the scenes).
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the things that really sparked my passion was working on real-life projects. These gave me hands-on 
            experience and helped me connect my skills to actual problems. Some of the projects I’m proud of include:
        </p>
        A customer loyalty prediction model that uses data to help businesses understand which customers are likely to 
        leave — and why.
        An aviation safety monitoring system designed to detect signs of pilot fatigue, using a mix of research, data input, and system logic.
        Several interactive dashboards in Power BI, where I turned raw data into easy-to-understand visuals to support decision-making.
        <p>
            Through these projects, I developed not only technical skills but also personal qualities like: 
        </p>
        <div class="developer-list">
            <li>Time management – balancing code deadlines with testing and fixing issues</li>
            <li>Critical thinking – solving unexpected problems when things didn’t work</li>
            <li>Teamwork – communicating with others, especially when working on group assignments or presenting results</li></li>
        </div>
        <p>What excites me most is that software development is always changing. There’s always something new to learn — 
            whether it's a new programming language, a better design practice, or a smarter way to handle data.
        </p>
        <p>I’m currently focused on growing both as a developer and a data enthusiast, aiming to build systems that are 
            not just functional, but also meaningful and user-friendly.
